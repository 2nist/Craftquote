### **🔧 PHASE 2: DATABASE INITIALIZATION**

#### **Step 3: Initialize Hierarchical Database**
1. Click **🚀 Initialize Database**
2. System creates 6 new sheets:
   - **HW_Parts** - Individual components
   - **HW_Assemblies** - Component groupings
   - **HW_BOM_Details** - Bill of materials
   - **HW_Panels** - Complete control systems
   - **HW_Projects** - Customer implementations
   - **HW_Quotes** - Final proposals

#### **Step 4: Verify Database Creation**
1. Check your spreadsheet tabs - you should see 6 new "HW_" sheets
2. Click **🔍 View Database Status** to see record counts:
   ```
   📊 DATABASE STATUS:
   Parts: 150+ records (from Master Catalog)
   Assemblies: 6 standard assemblies
   BOM Details: 0 records (populated as assemblies are created)
   Panels: 11 panel types (BHAC, DTAC, GHAC, etc.)
   Projects: 0 records (customer-specific)
   Quotes: 0 records (generated as needed)
   ```

### **🏗️ PHASE 3: ASSEMBLY BUILDER TESTING**

#### **Step 5: Test Assembly Creation**
1. Click **🏗️ Assembly Builder**
2. Modern interface should open with:
   - **Parts List** on left (searchable)
   - **Selected Parts** in middle (with quantities)
   - **BOM Summary** on right (with costs)

#### **Step 6: Create Test Assembly**
1. In parts search, type "motor"
2. Select a few motor-related components
3. Set quantities for each
4. Enter Assembly Name: "Test Motor Control"
5. Enter Description: "Test assembly for validation"
6. Click **Save Assembly**

**Expected Result:**
- Assembly saved to HW_Assemblies sheet
- BOM details saved to HW_BOM_Details sheet
- Success message displayed
- Assembly now available for quotes

### **📋 PHASE 4: QUOTE GENERATION TESTING**

#### **Step 7: Generate Test Quote**
1. Click **📋 Quote Generator**
2. Fill out customer information:
   - Company: "Test Company"
   - Contact: "Test Contact"
   - Description: "Test Quote for Validation"
3. Select assemblies (including your test assembly)
4. Click **Generate Quote**

**Expected Result:**
- Professional quote HTML generated
- Matches your reference PDF format exactly
- Includes company branding
- Shows hierarchical structure
- Displays proper pricing
- Quote saved to HW_Quotes sheet

---

### **🎬 PHASE 5: DEMONSTRATION WORKFLOW**

#### **Step 8: Run Demo Workflow**
1. Click **🎬 Demo Workflow**
2. System demonstrates complete workflow:
   - Creates sample assemblies
   - Builds BOM structures
   - Generates sample quotes
   - Shows all integration points
