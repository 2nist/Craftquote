## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **Testing Tips:**
1. **Test in order of priority** (Critical → High → Medium → Low)
2. **Test one item at a time** thoroughly
3. **Document everything** - even small observations
4. **Include screenshots** for visual issues
5. **Test edge cases** (empty fields, large data, etc.)

### **Reporting Tips:**
1. **Be specific** - "Button doesn't work" vs "CSV Import button shows error message"
2. **Include error messages** - Copy exact text of any errors
3. **Provide context** - What were you trying to accomplish?
4. **Test multiple times** - Is it consistent or intermittent?

### **Communication Tips:**
1. **Group related issues** - Send 3-5 items at once
2. **Include urgency** - Use priority levels appropriately
3. **Follow up** - Check back on fixed items
4. **Update status** - Mark items as completed when fixed

## 🔧 **Quick Actions**

### **Mark Multiple Items Ready:**
1. Select range in "Ready for Review" column
2. Type "Yes" and press Ctrl+Shift+Enter
3. Use "🔍 View Ready for Review" to see summary

### **Filter by Status:**
1. Click Data → Create a filter
2. Filter by Status, Priority, or Component
3. Focus on specific areas

### **Export for Developer:**
1. Use "🔍 View Ready for Review" 
2. Copy the generated summary
3. Send via your preferred communication method

## 📈 **Progress Tracking**

Monitor your testing progress:
- **Total Items**: Count of all test items
- **Completed**: Items marked as "Completed"
- **Failed**: Items needing developer attention
- **Remaining**: Items still "Not Started"

The system automatically tracks dates and provides a complete audit trail of your testing efforts.
