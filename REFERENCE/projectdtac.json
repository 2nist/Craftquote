  "notes": "System uses a single-target 'one shot' thermal control logic. Heating/cooling is disabled once the temp is reached; no reengagement is triggered unless the user sets a new target. Designed to reduce sensor noise and wiring complexity. Two HMI enclosures support full remote interaction. CAD and quote files include internal relay structure and remote input/output mapping.",
